**Overview:**

**Version 0.9.8 has just been released, see the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/pry/pry/blob/master/CHANGELOG) for information**

Welcome to the official guide for the Pry REPL: a powerful IRB alternative and
runtime developer console for Ruby. Note that not every  aspect of Pry is
covered in the material below, just a very significant chunk. For
basic information on getting started it is recommended you watch the
[introductory screencast](http://vimeo.com/26391171).

If you have any problems or queries first check the [FAQ](https://github.com/pry/pry/wiki/FAQ) and if you do not find what you need there [file an issue](http://github.com/pry/pry/issues) or [contact me](http://github.com/banister).

Thanks!
